Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

We're having a club championship on March 7th. Good luck to everyone going to Vancouver/Portland this week.

Ray and Chris won overall, while Pete and Clay won E/W. There are a couple of boards that might be mis-scored, or might be adjusted; if that's the case we'll revise the results next Tuesday.
