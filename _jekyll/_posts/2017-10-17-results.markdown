Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Good luck to all our regulars who are in Olympia, or who are heading there this weekend. Next week will be a Club Appreciation game. Same cost, extra masterpoints.

Congratulations to the Don Stark and his client who won Flights A and Flight B. Terry Jacobson and Brad Rind won Flight C.
