Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Our club had a great turnout in the North American Pairs last weekend. Congratulations to everyone who advanced to the national event - Steve Lewis, Jolanta Janowski, Brad Rind, Terry Jacobson, Dave Roselle, Hugh Hendrickson, Beau Hovda, John Krah, Daniel Poore, Tom & Jenni Carmichael, Han Antonson, and David Binney.

Good luck to everyone who is playing in the Halloween Sectional in Bothell this weekend!
