Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Apologies for the computer issues - we will try to get things straightened out by the next game.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT - there is no game next week because of the Lynnwood Regional. The week after will be our final NAP game of 2018.

Winners tonight in all flights were Peiyush Jain and Muhunthan Sivapragasam. Second were Doug Kuschner and Stan Christie.
