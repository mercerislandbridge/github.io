Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Best of luck to everyone in San Diego; we should be back to a normal game next week.

Shawn managed to drag her client to victory, which is probably even harder than it sounds. Kevin and David won B, and Brad and Terry pretended they're in C and won that. Congrats to all.
