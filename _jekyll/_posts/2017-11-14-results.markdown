Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Next week is an ACBL-Wide Charity Game. There will be scoring across the district and country for overall masterpoint awards in addition to the extra awards at the club.

Our winners tonight were Stan Christie and first time visitor Katrin Litwin - welcome to the club! Winners in Flight B and C were Karen Hudesman and Don Stark.

The strats tonight were a bit unbalanced between N/S and E/W. Please make sure to sit at a table that matches your masterpoint total when you arrive. If there aren't any, please ask a director so we can make sure the game stays balanced.

See you next week!
