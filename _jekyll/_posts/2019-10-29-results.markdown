Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

There were several suspicious results that I couldn't check before people left, so please be sure to check
your scores.

Good luck to everyone in Whistler, and we look forward to seeing you back next week!

Winners tonight were Eric Sieg and Kevin Castner just ahead of Ray Miller and Chris Pesce.
