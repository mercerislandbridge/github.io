Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Special welcome to Dan Goldfein! Thanks for joining us tonight.

Tonight's winners were Stan and Cornel (E/W), with Jen and Ray winning N/S. First in B was Grumpy Mike and DW. First in C were Becky and Eric. Next week is a "Junior Fund Game", and as such is an extra $1 (which goes to the Juniors), and of course extra masterpoints.
