Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Next week is a grassroots game that goes to support District 19 players in NAPs and GNTs. The game is $1 extra but you get extra masterpoints!

Tonight's winners were Eric Sieg and Stan Christie east/west and Brad Rind and Terry Jacobson N/S. Winners in B E/W were Chris Jarvis and Adam Ruprecht and winners in C were John Krah and Danielle Poore.
