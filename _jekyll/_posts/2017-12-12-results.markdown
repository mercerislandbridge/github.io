Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

We hope we'll see you next week at our Holiday Party! Please bring a festive attitude and a snack to share. It's also a club championship, so there will be extra masterpoints!

We will be closed the week after on December 26. Starting in January the game will be $10.

Congratulations to tonight's winners - Ken Christiansen and Dave Setterholm. They finished just ahead of John Krah and Daniel Poore who won Flights B & C. Our N/S winners were Kim Eng and Eric Sieg.
