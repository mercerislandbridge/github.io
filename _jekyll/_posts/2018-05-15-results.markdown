Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

It was very nice to welcome Christine and Lynn to our club. Welcome back to Oyvind, Cord, Dennis and Connie, and Arvind.

Tonights' winners were David and Kevin. Winning N/S were Chris and Ray (probably more Chris than Ray). Galen and Leah tied Jack and Rex for first in B one direction, and Brad and John won B and C the other way.
