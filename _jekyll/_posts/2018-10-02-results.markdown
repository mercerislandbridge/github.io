Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Tonight's winners were Jeff and Mr. Miller. Jeff's reward for winning was to spend lots of extra time figuring out why I couldn't send the results out last night. I'm sorry they're 12 hours late, but a couple of successive problems slowed us down. First E/W was our esteemed SUN editor, David Wright, and whatever client he was carrying.

Two weeks from now (10/16) is a club appreciation game, which usually means extra masterpoints but no extra cost.

Best of luck to anyone in or headed to Seaside this week.
