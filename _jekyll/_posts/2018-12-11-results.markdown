Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Next week is a Club Championship and Holiday Party! Our hospitality will
be potluck style, giving Ann a night off. It's also a good time to tell Ann how much you appreciate the
work she does to get snacks here week after week.

Our winners tonight were Ken Christiansen and Dave Setterholm. Flight B winners were David Hankins and Kevin
Cline. Flight C winners were Brad Rind and John Uchida.
