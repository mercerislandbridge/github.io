Thanks for coming to tonight's MUG game! Our overall winners were Ken Christiansen and Stan Christie. N/S winners were Kim Eng and Eric Sieg. Flight B winners were Chris Pesce and Jarvis. Flight C winners were Jack Yuan and Rex Tu.

Our next special game is an NAP game in two weeks.

We are still having some trouble with pairs not playing to the clock. Please remember that it is courteous to everyone to finish your rounds before the clock runs out. The directors will try to gently remind people to speed up, but if play is slow throughout the night we have no choice but to eventually remove boards - something we don't want to do.
