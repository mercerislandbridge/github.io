Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Thanks for coming to tonight's game. In two weeks we will be having a Junior Fund game - this costs $1 extra that goes to support Under-25 Bridge, and the winners all get extra masterpoints.

Tonight's winners in all three flights were Erik Sieg and Lak Lakshmanan with a huge 67% game. Congratulations!
