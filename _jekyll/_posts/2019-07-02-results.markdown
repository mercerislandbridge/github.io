Thanks for coming to tonight's game, and especially to those who brought treats to share. Next week's game will be an NAP qualifier. Good luck to everyone competing at the sectional this weekend!

Our winners tonight were Bryan Delfs and Jen Chalfan. Flight B winners were Nick Tipton and Galen Hesson. Flight C winners were Grace Shen (welcome to the club!) and Hugh Hendrickson.
