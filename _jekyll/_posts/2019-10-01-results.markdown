Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Good luck to everyone playing in Seaside!

Tonight we say a fond farewell to Pete Cowles, at least for a while - who would ever think that the Caribbean was a better place to spend the winter than Seattle?

Our top three places tonight were separated by only one matchpoint so check your scores. :) First was Bryan Delfs and Jen Chalfan, second were the Whites and third were Kim Eng and Chris Moore.
