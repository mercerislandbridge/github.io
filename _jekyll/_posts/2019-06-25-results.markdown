Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

There were four pairs tonight separated by only 1.5 matchpoints at the top - check your scores! The overall winners were David Binney and David Green by half a matchpoint over David Hankins and Kevin Cline. Winning E/W were Brian Zaugg and
Mike Ring.

Next week is our annual "Celebrate America" Party. We are giving Ann the night off, so please bring a snack to share!
