Thanks for coming to tonight's Grassroots Fund game. And good luck to our club members who will be representing the district in Vegas in a couple months! We will have a club championship in three weeks.

Winners tonight were Greg Herman and Eric Sieg in Flights A and B, just a bit ahead of Adam Ruprecht and Chris Jarvis. Our Flight C winners were Peiyush and Lak. Congratulations to all the winners.
