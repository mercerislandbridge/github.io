Thanks for coming to tonight's game. We hope everyone has a happy holiday season! Remember that we will have a game next Tuesday, December 27!

Special welcome to Tom and Jenni Carmichael - many of us have played against them before, but they are now moved to Seattle, and we hope to see them again soon.

Our winners tonight were Steve Beatty and Tom Carmichael. E/W winners were John Krah and Daniel Poore.
