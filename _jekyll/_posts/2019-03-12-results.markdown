Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Best of luck to everyone going to Everett this weekend, and to Memphis after! And a welcome back to Kevin who hasn't been with us in a while.

Please consider signing up for the Round Robin if you haven't already. It's flighted, and very social, and fun, a great chance to spend an evening with players you might not otherwise at their home. Highly recommended.

Tonight's winners were Joel Fuhrman and David Walker! Congrats. Second were Sue and DT! Third were Al and Andrea.
