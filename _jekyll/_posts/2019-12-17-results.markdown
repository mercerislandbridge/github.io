Happy holidays to everyone! The club will be closed the next two weeks for Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. We look forward to seeing you again in 2020.

In a tight race tonight our winners tonight were Mike Christensen and Becky Stevens, just half a matchpoint ahead of Eric Sieg and Greg Herman. Check your scores!

Due to a mistake a couple weeks ago, tonight's hands are not from the Common Game. We'll be back to those hands next time.
