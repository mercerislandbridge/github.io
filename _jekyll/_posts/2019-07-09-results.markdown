Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Looks like lots of folks were not up for a club game after playing all weekend at the sectional. Hopefully we'll be back to normal next week.

Please note we always try to have three strats, but when we hold an NAP qualifier we're not permitted to change the strats or average the pairs. Sorry! Next week is a normal game, but in two weeks when folks are at the summer nationals we'll have another NAP game.

One thing that came up tonight was a question about whether or not a cuebid overcall is an alert when it's not michael's and not natural. The minutia of the alert pamphlet says that this isn't alertable if it shows a two suiter where one of the suits isn't the suit you're overcalling in. Good to know --

Tonight's results were very tight, with only one board between 1st place and 9th place. Tonight's winners were Grant and John, congrats! 2nd place was Jeff and Dave.
