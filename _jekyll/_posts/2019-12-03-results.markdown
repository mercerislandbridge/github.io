Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Apparently the boards didn't match the hand records. We are working on it. Sorry about that.

Reminder, GNT Qualifier/team game at SBC Saturday Dec. 21st. Also there is a sectional at Fircrest the 13-15th.

Congratulations to tonight's winners- Bogdan/Cornel A, Gary and Sharon (B) and Guy/Beau (C).
