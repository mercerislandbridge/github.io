Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Please remember next week is our team game. Email us if you need help making a team; if we can help, we will.

Tonight's winners were Albert and Andrea, congrats! Right behind them (and also N/S) were Ray and Daniel. E/W was won by Joel and David W (Dave's come in six packs at our club).
