Thanks for coming to tonight's game. A warm welcome back to Jingsong who hasn't been with us in quite some time! It was also great to see Melinda again, and of course we are always happy to see the people who are here every week.

Winners tonight were Cornel in Bogdan in all three flights a bit ahead of Dave Roselle and Jingsong.
