Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

In two weeks we will be having a GNT Qualifier - this means you need a team of four not just a pair. If you are looking for a team, let us know and we will help people get matched up.

As a reminder this winter any time there is bad weather we will follow the Mercer Island school system for whether we are open.

Our winners tonight were Chris Moore and Kim Eng. N/S winners were Brian Zaugg and David Wright.
