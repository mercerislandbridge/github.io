Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

Next week will be a qualifier for the North American Pairs. Pairs who qualify will be eligible to play in the District Finals later this year where you have a chance to win a subsidized trip to next Spring's NABC. This game awards extra masterpoints and costs $1 more.

Our winners tonight were Bill Campbell and Mike Bovarnick (welcome back Mike!) North/South and Brad Rind and Terry Jacobson East/West.
