Thanks for coming to tonight's game. Our winners tonight were David Taylor and David Walker! Just behind them and winning Flight C were Brad Rind and Terry Jacobson.

There will be a special unit event this Sunday at Eastside Bridge Center. It's a Swiss Teams event, but there are restrictions on the number of masterpoints on the team. Check out the unit web page for more details.
