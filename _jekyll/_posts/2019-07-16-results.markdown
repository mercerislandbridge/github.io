Thanks for coming to tonight's game. A special welcome to our new players Jai Chakrapani and Robert Noble! And best of luck to all of our players who will be participating in the upcoming Las Vegas NABC.

Our game next week will be an NAP Qualifier. This is your chance to qualify for the district finals coming up later this year.

Our winners tonight were Bogdan and Cornel just edging out Min and Fan by half a mathpoint! They were also our Flight B winners. Flight C winners were Brad and Terry.
