Thanks for coming to tonight's game.

We're open every Tuesday this month, so please come out. You can only take so much relatives before you need a break! There are holiday parties at both SBC and ESBC this weekend. SBC's game is teams, ESBC's game is pairs.

Congrats to Jen and Bryan, who won tonight pending any errors. The two Mikes were second, and won E/W.
